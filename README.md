# A bookmark script generator

Sometimes we may want to run JavaScript for doing some automation tasks e.g.,
changing layout, fetching and saving data.

Most of the websites we can run some our own JavaScript to do some automate task
for ourself, and this project is for building and saving our handy script for
running later by simply clicking in a bookmark tab.
